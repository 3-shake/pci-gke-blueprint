# There is a 5 port per ILB maximium limit, the Kube API spec doesn't appear to
# support managing an ILB with ALL ports open mentioned in the documentation:
# (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/internal-load-balancing#limits).
# The solution is to split the ILBs in to nginx-listener-1|2
